
2080 Athlete Cardiac Arrests or Serious Issues, 1457 of Them Dead, Since COVID Injection

It is definitely not normal for so many mainly young athletes to suffer from cardiac arrests or to die while playing their sport, but Sincethe end of  2020 it is happening. Many of these heart issues and deaths come shortly after they got a COVID vaccine. While it is possible this can happen to people who did not get a COVID vaccine, the sheer numbers clearly point to the only obvious cause.

Important Notes: The number of dead are included in the total number. There are also dozens of reports that are not included in the total number shown in the headline because they are not or may not be vaccine-related, in our judgement.

The so-called health professionals running the COVID vaccine programs around the world keep repeating that “the COVID vaccine is a normal vaccine and it is safe and effective.”

gary dempsey 20 years
Gary Dempsey, professional soccer player played 500 games over 20 years, with no cardiac arrests.

In response to their pronouncement, here is a non-exhaustive and continuously growing list of mainly young athletes who had major medical issues in 2021/2022/2023 after receiving one or more COVID vaccines. Initially, many of these were not reported. We know that many people were told not to tell anyone about their adverse reactions and the media was not reporting them. They started happening and ramping up after the first COVID vaccinations. The mainstream media still are not reporting most, but sports news cannot ignore the fact that soccer players and other stars collapse in the middle of a game due to a sudden cardiac arrest. Many of those die – 69.4% as at 31st December 2022 and 70.1% as at 31st December 2023.

We also note that many posts in Facebook, Instagram, twitter, forums and news stories are being removed. So then we started receiving some messages saying there is no proof of the event or of vaccination status. That is partly because this information is being hidden.

More people are writing to tell us that in many cases, we didn’t mention a person’s vaccination status. There is a good reason for that. While everyone thought it was great marketing for them and a way of virtue-signalling, they bragged about their vaccination status. Now, none of the clubs want to reveal this information. None of their sponsors want to reveal it. The government doesn’t want it. Insurance companies aren’t asking for it. The players have been told not to reveal it. Most of the players’ relatives will not mention it. None of the media are asking this question. So what should we do? Stop this now? No, we will collect as much information as we can, while it is still available, because eventually, more information will come out, and we will be here to put it together.

Will it mean anything? We don’t know. What we do know is that there is a concerted world-wide effort to make this information go away, so that fact alone tells us it must be collected, investigated and saved so other researchers can look at it to see if there are any useful patterns. This may be one of the understatements of the century

We replaced about a dozen occurrences of the word “shot” with “injection” because translation into other languages is improved, on advice from a reader.

We really appreciate the athletes named in this list (or their families) who confirmed what happened to them so the truth can be known. They care about their fellow athletes, even if the clubs, their sponsors, media, politicians and so-called health professionals do not.

Contained in the list are many professional athletes and high level amateur athletes. It would not be sensible to try to report the death of every person on the planet, so we have selected a category of person who should be fit enough to lead a long and healthy life. This means that provided a person is reasonably fit, healthy and does some athletic activity, rather than an unfit “couch potato,” then they can be included in this list. Needless to say, these are only the persons reported to us by readers or that we discovered during research. Also note that almost all of these have been reported in the media. In some cases, we have a person’s own social media or reports from their family. For example, vocal pro-vaccination athlete Uche Nwaneri, the 38-year-old former Jacksonville Jaguars American Football player who said anti-vaxxers should be jailed – until he died suddenly.

There are many countries or states with large populations, that have almost no reports in our list. That probably means events are not being reported to us. The true death and injury numbers are likely to be very much higher than we list here.

Prior Year Data
The International Olympic Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland, studied documents from international data banks from 1966 to 2004. Those documents indicate 1,101 sudden deaths in athletes under 35 years of age, over 38 years, an average of 29 athletes per year, the sports with the highest incidence being soccer and basketball. Note the document says those sudden deaths were “predominantly caused by pre-existing congenital cardiac abnormalities.”

After the Lausanne report, all professional athletes are now screened for congenital abnormalities, so any comparison with previous years is not valid for those professionals, because people with congenital abnormalities have been screened out and cannot play. Many also have regular testing. So “something else” must be causing this sudden increase. (NIH Document) You can read the conclusions in this 2006 followup study. We leave the followups now to other researchers, hoping that this collection of data makes it easier for them to identify candidates for inclusion in the study.

A study by Maron on sudden death in US athletes, from 1980 to 2006 in thirty-eight sports identified 1,866 deaths of athletes with cardiac disease, over 26 years, with a prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

2005 to 2006 averaged sixty-six (66) deaths per year, with 82% of those occurring during competition or training.

Thanks to investigator readers for discovering these reports, and this story in Spanish: Momento Deportivo.

In 2021 and 2022, cardiac disease was only mentioned in two reports we found. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was only mentioned twice, and those two reports were listed in the “not vax related” list. “Enlarged heart” was only mentioned three times, but there was no indication this was a long-term or recent issue (possibly due to vaccine injury). We take this to mean that most of those with congenital heart conditions have already been screened out.

The above shows that in prior years, there were 66 deaths per year, but 97 were reported in the month of January 2022 alone, 416 in 2021, 791 in 2022 and 245 in 2023. None of these new deaths were reported to be due to congenital abnormalities, the primary cause found in previous years.

COVID Vaccine Trial Start Dates
The COVID-19 vaccine trials began in early 2020. Here are approximate start dates for prominent vaccine trials:

Pfizer-BioNTech: BNT162 started in April 2020.

Moderna: mRNA-1273 started in March 2020.

AstraZeneca-Oxford: started in April 2020.

Johnson & Johnson: started in September 2020.

Growing Report
This story will grow over time, as new information is added. If you have proof of information that we don’t already have, or if you have a correction, please send it through our contact form, with as much information as possible. Useful information would be the person’s name, age, what happened to them, if they had the COVID vaccine(s), date of event or death, link to any news story.

Special thanks to readers who have provided corrections, found errors that we missed, or provided new information we didn’t know about. It is now a real team effort and we appreciate it.

Currently reviewing 18 reports from October, November 2023.

Note: In 2022 and 2023, reports of the number of new cancers increased. In some places, some doctors reported 5 times more cancers than in 2020/21 and many of those are detected and immediately labeled stage 4. We leave it to others to draw conclusions from this, but there have been many newly-discovered cancer deaths around the world, often described as “died after a short illness.” One of our researchers knows 6 people in one family with terminal cancer that was discovered and went straight to stage 4. The youngest of the six tried to fight it off with chemotherapy, but died four months later.

For the skeptics who believe this is normal, feel free to repeat the following 18 words, after reading each name in this list.
