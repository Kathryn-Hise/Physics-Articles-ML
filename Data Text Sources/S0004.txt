The HOAX of “Climate Change”Published 1 year ago on September 12, 2022By Letter to the Editor
The HOAX of climate change (formally referred to as “Global Warming”) is being widely perpetrated on the American people by politicians, activists, and flawed scientists. The real science and associated data are either being ignored or modified to fit the political narrative.

Organizations such as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have modified/deleted “peer review” comments from scientists that challenge the IPCC Assessment Reports (AR1 thru AR5). In late 2009 a whistleblower leaked thousands of emails between scientists in high-ranking positions in the IPCC. These emails document their “unethical attempts to suppress contrary opinions and publications from climate skeptics.”

This “Climategate Scandal” (November 2009) exposed the data manipulation to hide the decline in air temperatures post-1980. Global warming stopped in the mid to late 90s. The data shows temperatures are actually cooling since that time frame.

The ultimate heat source for our planet is the Sun. Therefore, our temperatures are driven by the Sun. The history of sun activity is very revealing. From the Little Ice Age to the present decade, it has exhibited “cycles” of activity. These are referred to as “Relational cycles.” The “Dalton Minimum” circa 1793 is an example of these relational cycles. During these cycles, the Sun decreases heat output or solar hibernation.

The “bottom line” to this discussion is the FACT that humankind did not/cannot impact the natural cycles of the Sun. Climate change is a political hoax with no true basis in real science/data.
