 Eq. (A-1) in M&P
 h = Planck's constant, k = Boltzmann's constant, c = speed of light, T = temperature (in degK)
 B(T) is a function of the "wavelength"  (of electromagnetic waves)
 Fig. 2.2 in M&P
 The total (rate of) energy output is the integral of B(T) over .
 (More precisely, there's an additional factor of ; see next slide)

 A quick technical point:
 The B(T) in previous slide is the "monochromatic radiation intensity"
 (per radian solid angle). The "monochromatic irradiance (or radiative energy flux)"
 is B(T), provided that the radiation is isotropic (independent of direction).

For those who are really curious...
Think of a small area element at the surface of the sun: It emits radiation with the intensity of B(T)
in all direction, thereby producing a total energy flux of 4B(T), where 4 is the total solid angle of a
sphere enclosing that area element. Note, however, that a half of this energy flux goes back into the
interior of the sun. Of the other half that comes out of the surface, we are only concerned with the
component that is normal to the surface (which is the radiation that will go out to space for the
whole universe to see). In mathematical terms, the relevant radiative energy flux is
 ∫

B cosd  = B
.
Here, the integral is over the half sphere that raises above the surface of the sun,  is solid angle,
and  is the angle between a ray of radiation emitted by the small area element and the upward-pointing
vector normal to the surface of the sun.
No need to worry about this detail. For our purpose, it suffices to take the extra factor of  as given
and move on. Interested student can consult any textbook on atmospheric radiation (see instructor).

 Eq. (A-2) in M&P
 This is known as Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that
 the rate of outward radiative energy (per unit area) emitted by an object with
 temperature T is proportional to the 4th power of T
 The higher the temperature of an object, the greater its radiative energy output will be
 The Stefan-Boltzmann constant  ≈ 5.67  10-8 W m-2 K-4
 B(T) has the unit of W m-2
 The total outward radiative energy output of an object with surface temperature T
 and surface area A is B(T)  A
 The Sun
 Radius of the sun RS ≈ 696000 km, or 696000000 m

 Surface area of the sun, AS = 4  RS
2
 = 6.08 1018 m2
 Outward radiative energy flux (per unit area) at the sun's surface (T ≈ 6000K) is
 B(T) =  T
4
 = (5.67  10-8)  (6000)4
 = 7.35 107
 W m-2

 The total radiative energy output of the Sun is
 B(T)  AS ≈ 4.47 1026 W
 The actual temperature at the surface of the sun is slightly less than 6000K.
 This gives rise to the slightly smaller value of 3.87 1026 W in p. 9 of
 M&P textbook. We will follow the textbook by adopting this value.
 Every second, the Sun emits 3.87 1026 Joule of energy into the Universe.
 How much of it is intercepted by the Earth?
 The distance between the Sun and the Earth is RSE = 1 A.U.  150,000,000 km
 The big sphere centered at the Sun with a radius of RSE (see figure) has the total
 surface area of ASE = 4  (RSE)
2
. The energy output of the sun, 3.87 1026 W,
 is uniformly distributed on this sphere.
 The cross section (that intercepts sun light) of the Earth is CE =  (RE)
2
. where
 RE = 6370 km is earth's radius. (See next slide)
  The energy intercepted by the Earth is (3.87 1026 W)  (CE/ASE)   1017 W

 It is justifiable to assume that the sunlight that reaches the Earth
 is parallel. See next slide.

 "Plane Parallel" Assumption
 The sunlight that reaches the Earth can be considered "plane parallel"
 because of the large distance between the Sun and the Earth, and because
 of smallness of the Earth itself.


  AOB = 2  , where tan  = RE/RSE

 Solar constant
It is often more convenient to consider the radiative energy per cross-sectional unit area
that the Sun provides for the Earth system. This quantity is called the "Solar constant"
and is simply the total energy output of the sun divided by the the area (ASE) of the
"big sphere",
 So = (3.87 1026 W)/ASE 1368 W m-2

Sun Earth
Solar constant is the
energy flux per unit area
on this big sphere
 Multiply So by the cross section of the Earth, CE, we recover the total energy
 intercepted by the Earth as So  CE   1017 W. Recall that CE =  (RE)
2
.
 If we redistribute this amount of energy uniformly to the surface of the Earth,
 with its area being AE = 4  (RE)
2
, the energy per unit area of solar radiation
 received by the Earth would be
 So  CE/AE = So/4  W m-2
 Note:
 (1) This is assuming that the tropics and polar regions receive the same
 energy per unit area. In reality, the tropics receives more energy of course.

 (2) In determining the solar constant So or So/4, we have lumped together
 day and night and the four seasons; Note that Earth's cross sectional area
 never changes regardless of time of the day or day of the year. Therefore,
 The amount of solar energy intercepted by the Earth is the same all the time.
 (So does vary slightly with season because Earth's orbit is slightly elliptical. In the present
 epoch, Earth is slightly closer to the Sun during Northern Hemisphere winter. Let's not worry
 about such detail for now.)

 As an aside, the value of So/4  W m-2 is useful to remember at least for
 its "order of magnitude" when one thinks of solar energy applications.
 (A typical solar panel for household uses has the size of a few m2
. It's efficiency
 is however much less than 100%.)
 Note that the value, So/4  W m-2, is the average over day and night,
 winter and summer, and all latitudes. If you live on a tropical island, the
 local value would be higher.

 Part of the solar radiative energy from So/4  W m-2 is bounced back
 to space by reflection of Earth's surface and clouds (and to a lesser
 extent by the scattering by air molecules - this process is what makes
 the sky blue)
 If a fraction, p, of the solar radiative energy is bounced back to space,
 the net per-unit-area solar energy received by the Earth would be only

 (So/4) (1 - p)
 We call p the "planetary albedo", nominally defined as the global average
 of the reflectivity of the Earth system. We have some observations (mainly
 by satellites) to estimate this quantity.
 Fig. 2.5 in M&P (Ocean has small albedo; looks "dark" in satellite photos)
 Earth in radiative equilibrium
 If Earth keeps receiving energy from the Sun without giving it back
 (to space), it will become hotter and hotter. But recall that any object
 that has a non-zero temperature emits radiation. As Earth gets hotter,
 it emits more energy back to space. At a certain temperature TE, an
 equilibrium will be reached such that the solar energy received by the
 Earth equals the energy that the Earth radiates back to space.
 The incoming solar energy per unit area is (So/4) (1 - p)
 At temperature TE, the energy per unit area radiated by the Earth is
 (by Stefan-Boltzmann law)  TE
4
 Let "in = out",  TE
4
 = (So/4) (1 - p) , we have
 TE = [(1/)(So/4)(1 - p)]1/4
 For example, if p = 0.1, we have TE  271.4 K

 Note:
 (1) Given TE  271.4 K, we can plug it into B(T) to see that the peak
 wavelength in this case is ~ 10 m, in the infrared range.
  Earth emits primarily infrared radiation
 (2) The previous slide has not taken into account the fact that Earth's
 atmosphere can absorb infrared radiation (and re-emitting it back to
 the surface), preventing heat loss to space. The consequence is that
 Earth's surface would be warmer in the presence of "greenhouse gases"
 in the atmosphere
 For our purpose, the "greenhouse gases" are defined as the
 gases that absorb the infrared radiation emitted by a planet
